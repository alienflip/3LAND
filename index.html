			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				Hi there, so to introduce myself a little, I am Kai - I primarily have a background in Mathematics (BSc).
			</p>
			<p>
				During my degree, I studied for a year in Singapore at NUS. I had the option here to study the Philosophy of Science Fiction. It was incredible, as I had spent all of my GCSE years obsessed with Heidegger and his contributions to existentialism - but also with the epic sci-fi work of Heinlein.
			</p>
			<p>
				This period inspired me to learn to program. I started with Unity (video game dev, C#), and moved onto low(er) level systems (Mathematics visualisation, C/C++). 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since then, I have had the honour of working on varied tech stacks with great start-ups, medium sized software houses and big tech.
			</p>
			<p>
				Along side this, I like contributing to the open source community. Click on the <span style="color:rgb(252, 0, 227);">GITHUB</span> button to see some of my OS work.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am always interested in working with interesting individuals or groups, so please feel free to book a moment using the <span style="color:rgb(252, 0, 227);">BOOK A MEETING</span> button!
			</p>
